#to prompt people you can put your question inside input()
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How heavy are you? ")

print(f"So you're {age} years old, {height} tall, and {weight} pounds heavy.")
#pydoc input will tell you how input() works in python - it displays documentation, press q to quit

#input([prompt]) -> value, which is equivalent to using eval(raw_input(prompt))
